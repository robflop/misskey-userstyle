# misskey-userstyle
A hacked together userstyle I made for myself to use on Misskey

## Important:

I made this for my exact environment, i.e. browser, resolution and the way I like my screen space to look on Misskey.

The part that adjusts widgets will most likely not work 100% (or even at all) for anyone else that has a different setup, e.g. different widgets etc.

Since I made this for myself, I often (as horrible as it is) adjusted things by pixels instead of screen units or similar, so prepare for having to manually adjust those things for your own resolution, widget arrangement etc. It will also require manual updating for new Misskey versions at times, because i'm lazy and haven't looked into doing it properly yet.

In addition, you will need to update the domain the style applies to. I use the instance misskey.io, so that's what it's set to. Change that to the domain of the instance you use.

This is also why I don't plan on giving any in-depth help in case this doesn't work for someone else. This repo is mainly so I don't lose the style.

## Preview:

Again, refer to above notice. This is only the way it looks exactly for me, but it should provide reference.
