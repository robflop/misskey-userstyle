# misskey-userstyle
A hacked together userstyle I made for myself to use on Misskey

## Important:

I made this for my exact environment, i.e. browser, resolution and the way I like my screen space to look on Misskey.

The part that adjusts widgets will most likely not work 100% (or even at all) for anyone else that has a different setup, e.g. different widgets etc.

Since I made this for myself, I often (as horrible as it is) adjusted things by pixels instead of screen units or similar, so prepare for having to manually adjust those things for your own resolution, widget arrangement etc.

This is also why I don't plan on giving any in-depth help in case this doesn't work for someone else. This repo is mainly so I don't lose the style.
